# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a complete, functional React code example demonstrating an e-commerce checkout flow using the ckPayment SDK. The demo will serve as a comprehensive integration example that developers can fork and use as a starting point for their own e-commerce applications on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). The component will showcase real-world usage of ckPayment for handling ckBTC transactions in a shopping cart context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer exploring ckPayment integration, I want to see a complete e-commerce checkout example, so that I can understand how to implement ckPayment in a real shopping scenario.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo loads THEN the system SHALL display a shopping cart interface with at least 2-3 predefined products
2. WHEN products are displayed THEN each product SHALL show name, price in ckBTC, and quantity controls
3. WHEN the demo initializes THEN the system SHALL load the ckPayment SDK from "https://zkg6o-xiaaa-aaaag-acofa-cai.icp0.io/ckPay.js"
4. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL create a payment modal div for ckPayment integration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the demo, I want to manage items in my shopping cart, so that I can simulate a realistic e-commerce experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click add item THEN the system SHALL increase the quantity of that product in the cart
2. WHEN I click remove item THEN the system SHALL decrease the quantity or remove the product if quantity reaches zero
3. WHEN cart contents change THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate and display the total amount in ckBTC
4. WHEN the cart is empty THEN the checkout button SHALL be disabled
5. WHEN items are in the cart THEN the system SHALL display a clear list of cart items with individual prices and quantities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user ready to purchase, I want to initiate a ckPayment transaction, so that I can complete my purchase using ckBTC.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the checkout button THEN the system SHALL initialize ckPaySDK.PaymentComponent with the correct total amount
2. WHEN the payment modal opens THEN the system SHALL display the total amount in ckBTC clearly
3. WHEN payment is initiated THEN the system SHALL use ICP mainnet configuration
4. WHEN payment requires canister ID THEN the system SHALL use appropriate placeholder values for demonstration
5. WHEN payment is processing THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user completing a transaction, I want clear feedback on payment success or failure, so that I know the status of my purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with transaction details
2. WHEN payment succeeds THEN the system SHALL clear the shopping cart
3. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry the payment
5. WHEN payment callbacks are triggered THEN the system SHALL handle both success and error scenarios gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer wanting to use this demo, I want clean, well-styled code that I can easily fork and modify, so that I can quickly adapt it for my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the demo THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for clean, minimal styling
2. WHEN examining the code THEN the system SHALL be structured as a standalone React component
3. WHEN developers want to fork THEN the system SHALL be compatible with CodeSandbox or similar platforms
4. WHEN reviewing the implementation THEN the code SHALL include clear comments explaining ckPayment integration steps
5. WHEN adapting the code THEN the system SHALL use placeholder values that are easy to replace with real data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the demo, I want a responsive and accessible interface, so that I can use it effectively on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display properly with responsive design
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display messages in an accessible format
