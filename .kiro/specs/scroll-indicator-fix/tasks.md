# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create custom hook for scroll detection logic
  - Extract scroll detection logic into a reusable `useScrollDetection` hook
  - Implement intersection observer with proper configuration and cleanup
  - Add fallback scroll position detection for better reliability
  - Include debouncing mechanism to prevent excessive state updates
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Implement improved active section calculation algorithm
  - Create function to determine active section based on intersection ratios
  - Handle edge cases when multiple sections are visible simultaneously
  - Add logic to handle missing DOM elements gracefully
  - Implement scroll direction detection for better section transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Fix smooth scroll navigation with proper offset calculations
  - Refactor scrollToSection function with accurate position calculations
  - Account for navbar height and additional scroll offset in positioning
  - Implement scroll interruption handling for rapid navigation clicks
  - Add error handling for missing target sections
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Enhance accessibility and keyboard navigation
  - Add proper ARIA labels and roles to indicator buttons
  - Implement keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Space keys)
  - Ensure focus management and visual focus indicators
  - Add screen reader announcements for section changes
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Optimize performance and cleanup
  - Implement proper cleanup of intersection observers and event listeners
  - Add performance optimizations with throttling and debouncing
  - Handle component unmounting and route changes properly
  - Add error boundaries for graceful failure handling
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Improve visual feedback and hover states
  - Enhance hover states for inactive indicator dots
  - Implement smooth tooltip animations with proper positioning
  - Ensure active indicator maintains proper visual hierarchy
  - Add transition animations for state changes
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 7. Add responsive behavior and mobile optimization
  - Ensure proper hiding on mobile and tablet breakpoints
  - Test and optimize touch interaction behavior
  - Verify proper positioning across different screen sizes
  - Add responsive design considerations for various viewports
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive unit tests
  - Write tests for the useScrollDetection hook functionality
  - Test active section calculation logic with various scenarios
  - Create tests for smooth scroll navigation behavior
  - Add tests for accessibility features and keyboard navigation
  - _Requirements: All requirements for testing coverage_

- [ ] 9. Integrate and test the updated ScrollIndicator component
  - Replace the existing ScrollIndicator implementation
  - Test integration with the existing landing page sections
  - Verify proper behavior across different browsers
  - Conduct manual testing for smooth user experience
  - _Requirements: All requirements for final integration_
