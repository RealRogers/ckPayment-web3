# Design Document

## Overview

The ScrollIndicator component needs to be redesigned to provide reliable scroll detection, smooth navigation, and proper performance optimization. The current implementation has issues with intersection observer configuration, scroll position calculations, and state management that cause inconsistent behavior.

## Architecture

The component will use a hybrid approach combining Intersection Observer API for efficient scroll detection with manual scroll position calculations as a fallback. This ensures accurate section detection while maintaining good performance.

### Core Components

1. **Section Detection System**: Uses Intersection Observer with optimized thresholds
2. **Navigation System**: Handles smooth scrolling with proper offset calculations  
3. **State Management**: Manages active section state with debouncing
4. **Accessibility Layer**: Provides keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Components and Interfaces

### ScrollIndicator Component

```typescript
interface SectionConfig {
  id: string;
  label: string;
}

interface ScrollIndicatorProps {
  sections?: SectionConfig[];
  navbarHeight?: number;
  scrollOffset?: number;
  debounceDelay?: number;
}

interface ScrollState {
  activeSection: string;
  isScrolling: boolean;
  sectionsInView: Set<string>;
}
```

### Hook: useScrollDetection

```typescript
interface UseScrollDetectionOptions {
  sections: SectionConfig[];
  navbarHeight: number;
  scrollOffset: number;
  debounceDelay: number;
}

interface UseScrollDetectionReturn {
  activeSection: string;
  scrollToSection: (id: string) => void;
  isScrolling: boolean;
}
```

## Data Models

### Section Detection Logic

The component will track multiple pieces of data to determine the active section:

1. **Intersection Ratios**: How much of each section is visible
2. **Viewport Position**: Current scroll position relative to sections
3. **Section Boundaries**: Calculated positions of each section
4. **Scroll Direction**: Whether user is scrolling up or down

### State Management

```typescript
type SectionState = {
  id: string;
  element: HTMLElement | null;
  isVisible: boolean;
  intersectionRatio: number;
  offsetTop: number;
  height: number;
};
```

## Error Handling

### Missing DOM Elements
- Gracefully handle sections that don't exist in the DOM
- Log warnings for missing sections in development
- Continue functioning with available sections

### Intersection Observer Failures
- Implement fallback scroll listener if IntersectionObserver fails
- Detect browser compatibility and use appropriate method
- Provide manual scroll position calculation as backup

### Performance Issues
- Implement proper cleanup of observers and listeners
- Use debouncing for rapid scroll events
- Throttle intersection observer callbacks

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. **Section Detection Logic**
   - Test intersection observer setup and cleanup
   - Verify active section calculation with various scroll positions
   - Test debouncing behavior

2. **Navigation Functions**
   - Test smooth scroll behavior
   - Verify offset calculations for different navbar heights
   - Test scroll interruption and cancellation

3. **State Management**
   - Test state updates during scroll events
   - Verify proper cleanup on component unmount
   - Test edge cases with missing sections

### Integration Tests
1. **DOM Interaction**
   - Test with actual DOM elements and scroll behavior
   - Verify intersection observer triggers correctly
   - Test keyboard navigation and accessibility

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure scroll event handling performance
   - Test memory leaks with observer cleanup
   - Verify smooth animation performance

### E2E Tests
1. **User Workflows**
   - Test clicking indicators to navigate sections
   - Verify scroll position accuracy across different screen sizes
   - Test accessibility with keyboard and screen readers

## Implementation Details

### Intersection Observer Configuration

```typescript
const observerOptions = {
  root: null,
  rootMargin: `-${navbarHeight}px 0px -${Math.floor(window.innerHeight * 0.7)}px 0px`,
  threshold: [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
};
```

### Active Section Algorithm

1. Get all sections currently intersecting with viewport
2. If multiple sections are visible, choose the one with highest intersection ratio
3. If no sections are intersecting, use scroll position to determine closest section
4. Apply debouncing to prevent rapid state changes during scroll

### Smooth Scroll Implementation

```typescript
const scrollToSection = (targetId: string) => {
  const element = document.getElementById(targetId);
  if (!element) return;
  
  const targetPosition = element.offsetTop - navbarHeight - scrollOffset;
  
  window.scrollTo({
    top: targetPosition,
    behavior: 'smooth'
  });
};
```

### Accessibility Enhancements

- Use proper ARIA labels and roles
- Implement keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
- Provide screen reader announcements for section changes
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for indicators
- Add focus management for better keyboard experience
