# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollIndicator component is currently not working properly. Users expect a smooth, accurate navigation experience where the scroll indicator correctly highlights the current section and provides reliable navigation to different sections of the landing page. The component should provide visual feedback about the user's current position on the page and allow quick navigation between sections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing the landing page, I want the scroll indicator to accurately highlight which section I'm currently viewing, so that I always know my position on the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls to a section THEN the corresponding indicator dot SHALL be highlighted immediately
2. WHEN a user is between sections THEN the indicator SHALL highlight the section that occupies the majority of the viewport
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the indicator SHALL correctly highlight the hero section by default
4. IF a section is less than 50% visible THEN the indicator SHALL NOT highlight that section

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on any indicator dot to smoothly navigate to that section, so that I can quickly jump to content I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks an indicator dot THEN the page SHALL scroll smoothly to the corresponding section
2. WHEN scrolling to a section THEN the target section SHALL be positioned correctly below the fixed navbar
3. WHEN a scroll animation is in progress THEN subsequent clicks SHALL cancel the current animation and start a new one
4. WHEN the scroll completes THEN the indicator SHALL immediately reflect the new active section

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the scroll indicator to be responsive and accessible, so that it works well across all my devices and for users with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop (lg breakpoint and above) THEN the scroll indicator SHALL be visible on the right side
2. WHEN viewing on mobile or tablet THEN the scroll indicator SHALL be hidden to avoid cluttering the interface
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN users SHALL be able to focus and activate indicator buttons using keyboard
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN each indicator button SHALL have proper ARIA labels and current state indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scroll indicator to perform smoothly without causing performance issues, so that my browsing experience remains fluid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling rapidly THEN the indicator updates SHALL be debounced to prevent excessive re-renders
2. WHEN the component unmounts THEN all event listeners and observers SHALL be properly cleaned up
3. WHEN sections are not found in the DOM THEN the component SHALL handle missing elements gracefully
4. WHEN the user navigates away from the home page THEN the scroll indicator SHALL not be rendered

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback when hovering over indicator dots, so that I understand they are interactive elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over an inactive indicator dot THEN it SHALL show a subtle hover state
2. WHEN hovering over any indicator dot THEN a tooltip SHALL appear showing the section name
3. WHEN the active indicator is hovered THEN it SHALL maintain its active appearance while showing the tooltip
4. WHEN focus moves away from an indicator THEN the tooltip SHALL disappear smoothly
