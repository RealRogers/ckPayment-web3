# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing HowItWorksSection.tsx component to create a more polished, engaging, and visually consistent experience that aligns with the IntegrationHub.tsx component. The enhancement will transform the current basic implementation into a professional developer hub section with timeline-based layouts, improved interactivity, and consistent styling patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer visiting the website, I want to see a visually appealing and well-structured "How It Works" section that matches the quality and design consistency of other sections, so that I feel confident about the platform's professionalism and can easily understand the integration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the How It Works section THEN the section SHALL display a header with pill-like badge, gradient text, and call-to-action button matching IntegrationHub's style
2. WHEN a user views the section THEN the layout SHALL use consistent gradients, spacing, and typography with other hub sections
3. WHEN a user interacts with the section THEN all interactive elements SHALL provide appropriate hover states and transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer exploring integration options, I want to see enhanced tab navigation with clear visual indicators and comprehensive information per tab, so that I can quickly identify the best integration method for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the tabs THEN each tab trigger SHALL display an icon and title in a full-width layout
2. WHEN a user selects a tab THEN the tab content SHALL show a per-tab header with large icon, badge (e.g., 'Recommended', 'Mobile-First', 'Enterprise'), difficulty level, and time estimate
3. WHEN a user views tab content THEN each tab SHALL include a descriptive subtitle explaining the integration approach
4. WHEN a user switches between tabs THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and maintain visual consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer following integration steps, I want to see a clear timeline-based layout with numbered steps and organized code examples, so that I can easily follow the implementation process in the correct order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views integration steps THEN the steps SHALL be displayed as a vertical timeline with numbered circles and connecting lines
2. WHEN a user views each step THEN the step SHALL show a grid layout with step information on one side and code block on the other
3. WHEN a user views code blocks THEN each code block SHALL display the programming language label (e.g., 'HTML', 'JavaScript', 'cURL')
4. WHEN a user views the timeline THEN connecting lines SHALL properly align between step numbers on all screen sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer copying code examples, I want an enhanced copy functionality with visual feedback and error handling, so that I can efficiently use the provided code snippets in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the copy button THEN the code SHALL be copied to clipboard and display a "Copied!" popup message
2. WHEN the copy operation succeeds THEN the button icon SHALL temporarily change to a checkmark for 2 seconds
3. WHEN the copy operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error toast with fallback instructions
4. WHEN a user hovers over code blocks THEN the blocks SHALL show subtle hover effects indicating interactivity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating integration options, I want to see key features and benefits listed for each integration type, so that I can understand the advantages of each approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a tab's content THEN a features section SHALL be displayed at the bottom with check icons
2. WHEN a user views features THEN each feature SHALL be clearly labeled with appropriate icons (e.g., CheckCircle for completed features)
3. WHEN a user views the features section THEN it SHALL use consistent styling with muted backgrounds and proper spacing
4. WHEN a user compares tabs THEN each integration type SHALL show relevant features (e.g., 'Browser-native' for web, 'Cross-platform' for mobile, 'Webhook support' for API)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using the site on different devices, I want the enhanced How It Works section to be fully responsive and accessible, so that I can access the information effectively regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the section on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately with proper spacing and readable text
2. WHEN a user views tabs on small screens THEN tab triggers SHALL stack or compress appropriately while maintaining usability
3. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be properly focusable and accessible
4. WHEN a user uses screen readers THEN all code blocks and interactive elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer exploring the platform, I want the How It Works section to integrate seamlessly with other sections and provide clear next steps, so that I can continue my journey through the documentation and integration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the documentation button THEN it SHALL open the full documentation in a new tab
2. WHEN a user completes viewing the How It Works section THEN clear next steps or related sections SHALL be suggested
3. WHEN a user views the section THEN it SHALL maintain visual consistency with IntegrationHub and other developer-focused sections
4. WHEN a user interacts with the section THEN toast notifications SHALL use the existing toast system for consistency
