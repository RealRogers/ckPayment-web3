# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses TypeScript errors and improves form validation and error handling across the ckPayment application. The current ProfileManagement component has type safety issues when displaying form errors, and we need to create a robust, reusable system for handling form validation errors that works seamlessly with react-hook-form, Zod validation, and TypeScript.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe form error handling, so that I can display validation errors without TypeScript compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a form validation error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error message as a properly typed ReactNode
2. WHEN multiple validation errors exist for a field THEN the system SHALL display the first relevant error message
3. WHEN an error object is complex (FieldError type) THEN the system SHALL extract the message string safely
4. IF an error message is undefined THEN the system SHALL display a fallback error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable error display components, so that I can maintain consistent error handling across all forms in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating form components THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable FormError component
2. WHEN displaying field errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and iconography
3. WHEN errors are displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
4. WHEN error states change THEN the system SHALL animate transitions smoothly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and helpful error messages, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a validation error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a human-readable error message
2. WHEN file upload validation fails THEN the system SHALL specify the exact issue (size, type, etc.)
3. WHEN required fields are empty THEN the system SHALL indicate which fields need to be filled
4. WHEN field length limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL show current vs maximum character counts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe form utilities, so that I can handle form errors consistently without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting error messages THEN the system SHALL provide a utility function that handles all FieldError types
2. WHEN checking for field errors THEN the system SHALL provide type guards for error existence
3. WHEN working with nested form errors THEN the system SHALL handle complex error objects safely
4. IF error extraction fails THEN the system SHALL return a safe fallback value

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want accessible error handling, so that I can use the application with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form errors are displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN error states change THEN the system SHALL announce changes to screen readers
3. WHEN focusing on invalid fields THEN the system SHALL associate error messages with form controls
4. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus management during error states
