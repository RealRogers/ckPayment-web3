# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines improvements to the existing ICP Developer Dashboard to enhance its blockchain-specific capabilities, real-time data handling, and error management. The improvements focus on making the dashboard more suitable for ICP blockchain development with better data models, real-time updates, and comprehensive error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ICP-Specific Data Models Enhancement

**User Story:** As an ICP developer, I want to see blockchain-specific transaction details like cycle costs and subnet information, so that I can better understand the performance and costs of my canister operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing transaction details THEN the system SHALL display cycle cost information for each transaction
2. WHEN viewing transaction details THEN the system SHALL show the subnet ID where the transaction was processed
3. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL calculate and display average cycle costs per transaction type
4. WHEN viewing subnet information THEN the system SHALL show subnet uptime and performance metrics
5. IF a transaction involves inter-canister calls THEN the system SHALL display the call hierarchy and associated costs
6. WHEN exporting transaction data THEN the system SHALL include all ICP-specific fields in the export

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Data Updates Implementation

**User Story:** As an ICP developer, I want to receive real-time updates about my canister's performance and transactions, so that I can monitor critical events as they happen without manual refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is active THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for real-time updates
2. WHEN new transactions occur THEN the system SHALL push updates to the dashboard within 2 seconds
3. WHEN canister metrics change significantly THEN the system SHALL notify the user with visual indicators
4. WHEN the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to polling with exponential backoff
5. IF real-time updates are unavailable THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the data freshness status
6. WHEN receiving real-time updates THEN the system SHALL animate new data entries to draw user attention
7. WHEN the user is inactive for 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL reduce update frequency to conserve resources

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Error Handling and Categorization

**User Story:** As an ICP developer, I want detailed error information with proper categorization and logging, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues with my canister integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL categorize it as NetworkError, CanisterError, ValidationError, or AuthenticationError
2. WHEN a CanisterError occurs THEN the system SHALL display the specific canister error code and message
3. WHEN a NetworkError occurs THEN the system SHALL show connection status and suggest retry actions
4. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console with context
5. IF errors are frequent THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures
6. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically clear error states and resume normal operation
7. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recovery suggestions to the user

### Requirement 4: Advanced Metrics and Analytics

**User Story:** As an ICP developer, I want comprehensive analytics about my canister's performance including cycle usage patterns and subnet health, so that I can optimize my application's efficiency and costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display cycle usage trends over time
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL show transaction throughput per subnet
3. WHEN viewing costs THEN the system SHALL calculate and display cost per operation type
4. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL show subnet uptime and response time metrics
5. IF cycle usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL display warning indicators
6. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL show percentage changes in key metrics
7. WHEN exporting analytics THEN the system SHALL include all calculated metrics and trends

### Requirement 5: Improved User Experience and Notifications

**User Story:** As an ICP developer, I want intuitive notifications and visual feedback about my canister's status, so that I can quickly understand the current state and any issues that need attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time updates arrive THEN the system SHALL use subtle animations to highlight changes
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display toast notifications with appropriate severity levels
3. WHEN data is stale THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators of data age
4. WHEN connection status changes THEN the system SHALL update the connection indicator immediately
5. IF the user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on success or failure
6. WHEN viewing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling for performance
7. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN the system SHALL show success notifications to confirm resolution

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Configuration and Monitoring

**User Story:** As an ICP developer, I want to configure real-time update preferences and monitor system health, so that I can customize the dashboard behavior according to my workflow needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of update frequencies
2. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling specific real-time features
3. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL display connection quality metrics
4. WHEN configuring alerts THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom thresholds for notifications
5. IF bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL provide options to reduce data transfer
6. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL optimize real-time features for mobile networks
7. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust update frequencies
