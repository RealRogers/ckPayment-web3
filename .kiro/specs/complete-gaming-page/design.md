# Design Document

## Overview

The Gaming page completion will transform the current incomplete page into a comprehensive, fully-featured landing page that matches the quality and completeness of the Education page. The design will maintain the gaming-specific purple/pink color scheme while adding missing sections and improving code quality.

## Architecture

The Gaming page will follow a sectioned layout pattern similar to the Education page:

1. **Hero Section** (existing) - Main value proposition with animated background
2. **Stats Section** (existing) - Key metrics and benefits
3. **Features Section** (existing) - Core gaming features
4. **Integration Steps Section** (new) - Step-by-step implementation guide
5. **Use Cases Section** (new) - Different gaming scenarios and applications
6. **Competitive Advantages Section** (new) - Traditional vs ckPayment comparison
7. **FAQ Section** (new) - Common questions and answers
8. **Call-to-Action Section** (new) - Final conversion section
