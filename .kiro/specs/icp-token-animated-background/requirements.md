# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing AnimatedBackground.tsx component to include ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) integration with multi-token support. The enhancement will display thematic particles representing different tokens (ckBTC, ckETH) that symbolize automatic token selection based on balance detection and fiat conversions. This creates a more engaging and informative visual experience that reduces user friction by providing real-time token information through the animated background.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the landing page, I want to see animated token particles in the background that represent real ICP tokens, so that I can visually understand the multi-token support and feel engaged with the platform's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display animated particles that include SVG icons representing ckBTC and ckETH tokens
2. WHEN particles move across the canvas THEN the system SHALL render token SVG icons as part of the particle animation
3. WHEN the animation runs THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance with optimized particle count and requestAnimationFrame
4. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL responsively adjust the canvas and particle positions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the animated background to reflect real-time token data from ICP canisters, so that the visual representation is connected to actual blockchain data and provides meaningful information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL query an ICP canister to fetch token exchange rates via HTTPS outcalls
2. WHEN token data is received THEN the system SHALL update particle properties (color, size, or visual indicators) based on the fetched data
3. IF the canister query fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to default particle behavior without breaking the animation
4. WHEN token rates change THEN the system SHALL reflect these changes in the particle visual properties

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced animated background to be modular and maintainable, so that it can be easily updated and doesn't impact other components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript types for all ICP-related data structures
2. WHEN the component is used THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing API and not require changes to parent components
3. WHEN adding ICP functionality THEN the system SHALL properly handle @dfinity/agent imports and canister interactions
4. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup all resources including animation frames and canister connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the token particle animation to work smoothly across all screen sizes and device capabilities, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL reduce particle count to maintain performance
2. WHEN the device has limited resources THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize animation complexity
3. WHEN the canvas resizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper particle distribution and SVG icon scaling
4. WHEN particles reach screen boundaries THEN the system SHALL handle collision detection appropriately for the responsive layout
