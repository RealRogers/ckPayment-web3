# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Developer Dashboard Enhancement project aims to transform the current basic dashboard overview into a comprehensive, interactive, and ICP-specific developer tool. Building upon the existing solid foundation (dark mode design, basic KPIs, tab structure), this enhancement will add deep interactivity, real-time ICP on-chain metrics, advanced data visualization, and actionable management features. The goal is to create a production-ready dashboard that serves as both a functional tool and a showcase of ICP platform capabilities, inspired by Stripe's developer-friendly approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Interactive Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with comprehensive analytics that include charts, filters, and real-time data, so that I can monitor and analyze my ICP application performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Analytics tab is loaded THEN the system SHALL display interactive Recharts visualizations including LineChart for revenue trends, BarChart for error distribution, PieChart for token breakdown, and AreaChart for cumulative metrics
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL provide date range filters and export functionality for data analysis
3. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show ICP-specific data including cycle usage, token breakdowns (ckBTC, ckETH), and on-chain transaction details
4. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates every 30 seconds with visual indicators
5. WHEN charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL include hover tooltips, drill-down capabilities, and responsive design for mobile devices

### Requirement 2: Advanced Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage comprehensive ICP-specific configurations including multi-token support, canister settings, and security options, so that I can customize my application behavior efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Config tab is accessed THEN the system SHALL display forms for canister ID configuration, principal receiver settings, and multi-token toggles (ckBTC, ckETH)
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation and test connectivity functionality
3. WHEN API keys are managed THEN the system SHALL provide secure display (masked), generation, rotation, and copy-to-clipboard functionality
4. WHEN security settings are accessed THEN the system SHALL include 2FA setup, IP whitelisting, and transaction limits configuration
5. WHEN configurations are saved THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and test the configuration against live canisters

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Webhook Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage webhooks with full CRUD operations, testing capabilities, and performance monitoring, so that I can integrate external services reliably with my ICP applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Webhooks tab is accessed THEN the system SHALL display a table of webhooks with status indicators, success rates, response times, and last triggered timestamps
2. WHEN managing webhooks THEN the system SHALL provide forms to create, edit, and delete webhook endpoints with URL validation and event type selection
3. WHEN testing webhooks THEN the system SHALL provide real-time testing functionality with immediate feedback and error details
4. WHEN viewing webhook logs THEN the system SHALL display recent triggers, error messages, and performance metrics with filtering capabilities
5. WHEN managing multiple webhooks THEN the system SHALL provide bulk operations for enabling/disabling webhooks

### Requirement 4: Real-time Transaction Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view and manage recent transactions with detailed information and refund capabilities, so that I can handle payment operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing recent transactions THEN the system SHALL display a table with transaction ID, amount, token type, status, user information, and timestamps
2. WHEN transaction details are needed THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down functionality to view complete transaction information
3. WHEN refunds are necessary THEN the system SHALL provide refund buttons that trigger on-chain refund transactions
4. WHEN managing transactions THEN the system SHALL include search, filtering, and pagination capabilities
5. WHEN transactions are processed THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates and confirmation messages

### Requirement 5: ICP-Specific Metrics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor ICP-specific metrics including cycle usage, subnet performance, and on-chain data, so that I can optimize my application's blockchain performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ICP metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show cycle burn rates, subnet uptime, and canister performance statistics
2. WHEN monitoring blockchain data THEN the system SHALL display token-specific metrics for ckBTC, ckETH, and other supported tokens
3. WHEN viewing performance data THEN the system SHALL include charts for cycle usage over time and transaction throughput
4. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL display notifications for high error rates, low cycle balance, or performance anomalies
5. WHEN blockchain data is accessed THEN the system SHALL query live canister data with fallback to mock data for demo purposes

### Requirement 6: Enhanced User Experience and Interactivity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an intuitive and responsive dashboard experience with advanced filtering, export capabilities, and accessibility features, so that I can efficiently manage my applications across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using filters THEN the system SHALL provide date range pickers, token type filters, and status filters with immediate results
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL offer CSV and JSON export options for all tables and charts
3. WHEN accessing on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly interactions, collapsible sections, and optimized chart viewing
4. WHEN using accessibility features THEN the system SHALL include ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high contrast mode
5. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback, loading states, and success/error notifications using toast messages
